# Description
Having completed the Monster Game project, I can confidently say that I have gained valuable experience in working with classes, code modules, and executing Node.js code using VSCode. This extra credit project allowed me to delve deeper into understanding and utilizing the concepts taught throughout the course.

At the outset of the project, I familiarized myself with the provided code files: p5.js, p5-monster-game.js, and p5-monster.js. The p5.js file served as the main entry point for the game, where I declared the list of monsters and their properties, as well as the game configuration properties. I also created an instance of the MonsterGame class and listed the game monsters and their initial values.

In the p5-monster-game.js file, I added the necessary code to define the MonsterGame class. The class constructor accepted an object parameter with initial game values and created the initial list of monsters. To list each monster, I implemented the listMonsters() method using the forEach() array method and template literals to output the desired information.

Additionally, I wrote the createMonsters() method, which created an array of monster objects using the Monster class from the p5-monster.js code module. This involved understanding how to export and import classes between code modules. The playGame() method was another crucial aspect of the project. It allowed each monster to randomly drain life after a specific interval of time until all monsters had died. This method incorporated concepts such as Promises and async/await, which I found particularly valuable in expanding my understanding of asynchronous programming.

In the p5-monster.js file, I developed the Monster class from scratch. The class constructor accepted an object parameter, deconstructed it, and assigned the necessary properties with specified default values. I also used a one-line statement to set the initial value of the isAlive property based on the currentLife and minimumLife values. The updateLife() method was responsible for adjusting the currentLife based on the provided lifeChangeAmount. By employing one-line statement constructions like the ternary operator, I avoided using if() statements. The randomLifeDrain() method, another class method, calculated a random life drain within the given range and called the updateLife() method accordingly. Throughout the code, I used template literals for console.log() statements to output the required information.

Reflecting on this project, I appreciate the opportunity it provided to gain practical experience in working with classes, objects, and arrays. It allowed me to reinforce my understanding of class constructors, methods, and the usage of code modules. Furthermore, I gained proficiency in debugging Node.js code using VSCode and effectively utilizing breakpoints to examine the execution flow.

Completing the Monster Game project has undoubtedly expanded my knowledge and confidence in working with classes and code modules. The hands-on experience has equipped me with the skills necessary to design and implement classes, interpret and modify existing code, and utilize core JavaScript concepts effectively.
